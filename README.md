Yolanda Info Classifier
=======================
Social media has made it easier to relay information for the Haiyan/Yolanda rescue effort however, there is so much information with very varied content making it difficult to look for specific information.

The goal of this project is to use a mix of crowdsourcing and machine learning to categorize information. This will make it easier for people to look for a specific type of information and also for other projects to leverage on.
